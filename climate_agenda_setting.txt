I am a policy entrepreneur for climate policy issue (CPI) in USA, which is heavily governed by politicians whose pockets are lined by the Fossil Fuel industry. I want to transition from coal to clean energy in the light of recent reports from Climate scientist that we are close to tipping point of Global Warming. The time is short since we aren’t on track to reduce our carbon emissions by 2050 and drastic steps need to be taken. But from historical evidence, as in case of Green New Deal [1][2], radical green policies rarely get passed.

The most effective way to bring the issue to political agenda is using the Multiple Streams Approach. This relies on convergence from Problem, Policy and Politics and striking when the iron is hot. 2020 is the year of convergence for green policy. From 2019, Bernie’s green new deal ignited powerful conversations regarding climate and with increased droughts, forest fires in Amazon and heat waves, global warming has been in the forefront [1]. Top that with Covid, where people have become more aware environmental damage they may be causing [3]. Gen-Z is leading the charge in ensuring there is a viable future [5]. There is an urgency to fix the climate change issue as scientists have warned of catastrophic consequences if quick action is not taken and in rational scenarios, global warming would have been #1 issue globally. From the policy aspect, there a lot of research post the Green New Deal controversy with regards to CPI. Policymakers and think tanks that I have built relationships with, are prepared to handle any question or doubts from opposing party for the policy. Lastly, due to upcoming elections, the 2020 democratic candidates have all leaned left for all CPIs and are willing to take action for it. [4]. To bring (CPI) to formal agenda, I would use the Outside initiative model. We know science and general public has been protesting since 2019 and we want to push for reforms by passing on those grievances to policymakers in order to pressure them. I would push think tanks such as Center for Climate and Energy Solutions [6] (who have subject matter expertise) to present their findings to USA House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis [7] (the CPI policymakers). This would ensure ideal collaboration between Science, Politicians and public to enable CPI into agenda setting. Due to nature of current energy industry with incumbent, any change to CPI will result in a Punctuated Decision making with rapid changes. 

Due to the significant elite power of the fossil fuel industry we would want to ensure that second face of power doesn’t come into play. Which is when agenda item is only set when policymaker finds it worth consideration. We want to be prepared for third face of power which is when we are under prepared and have not fully explored the policy. This is what happened to Green deal which got torn into shreds due to high level of ambiguity. Climate change is a complex as well as intersectional problem. Its without global boundaries and can exacerbate problems such as migration, poverty and gender equality. Hence multiple dependencies come into play as we grapple with CPI. Which is why we suggest spending a good chunk of time on agreeing what the end objective is whether we want to switch over to 0% emissions or 10%. We need to track the development targets that will affected by this transition to ensure sustainable change. Due to complexity and massive scale, we also need to ensure that adequate resources are available as well as there is a project manager assigned to assist with planning out execution. As many countries and nonprofits would be involved, we should ensure communication amongst parties but also reduce organization dependencies to ensure speed of execution. We should involve bureaucrats in decision making to ensure we utilize their grass root knowledge and reduce agent slippage due to lack of motivation.

Evaluations should be conducted by non-governmental stakeholders to ensure integrity. We will only evaluate process evaluations and could do cost benefit analysis but since CPI unchecked is grave we will not take into consideration the cost, even though costs are high and ambitious.  Just as 2020, we should plan to showcase the results when the opportunity is correct. I would prefer having a short (one pager) policy brief which is shown to policymaker during a presentation. This ensures the policymaker is aware of the numbers but also can explore the results post the meeting at their own pace. Only including salient numbers ensures better retention for the policymaker. We want to include stakeholders such as advocacy groups, committees to ensure that policy maker gets consistent information from all sources.
